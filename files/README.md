# MATH280 files

This repository contains jupyter notebooks and other python files for use in the course MATH280 Applied Linear Algebra at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences.

You can either run the notebooks on JupyterLite in your browser using the link below, or clone the repository to your own computer and run the files using your own installation.

If you run the notebooks in your browser, you can edit them and save your own files in the browser. **These changes are stored in your browser's cache**. You can return to them as long as you are using the same browser on the same computer. They will disappear if you clear your cache. 

If you want safer storage of your notebooks, you can "download" files from the JupyterLite interface to your computer or cloud storage and later "upload" them later.
